Blag is a blog inspired by that _XKCD_ comic.<br>
Made entirely for fun, this is one of the most interesting projects i've worked on.<br>
And so its development shall continue.<br>
Someday, we will discover how to delete entries in it. Someday.<br>
<hr>
Why did I choose to make this?<br>
Why use something that someone has made when you can use your own?<br>
(other than the obvious reasons...)
<br>
To install, plonk it somewhere and go to /install. Enter all required stuff for the SQL thing.<br>
Also delete the `$installed = 'true';` from user.php because I need that to test with, and don't feel like removing it every time.<br>

Uses the awesome [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com/ "TinyMCE website") for the edit page if you want it to.<br>
Also uses [PACE](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/ "Pace website") for pageload animations if you want.
<br>

note: the pabian.me server seems to have something wrong with running php correctly.
I cannot fix that because I do not own the website :(
